"""Strict form admission for the asset upload route, retaining File/Form schema.

Register only the asset upload POST with this APIRoute. The multipart parser
subclass and request._form cache integration are covered by compatibility tests
against pinned Starlette 1.7.0 / python-multipart 0.0.32. Upstream's finalize()
does not reject a truncated normal EOF, so completion and all temporary file
handles are checked here. Upstream header/boundary limits remain unchanged.
