> Use the authenticated API for one quick H3 clip or a multi-chapter story. Save the same prompt, separate media inputs and controls the user can edit on the website; plan generation and adopt candidates.

## Start here
- [Agent onboarding](/for-agents): Public HTML; no JavaScript or login is needed to read it.
- [Machine-readable guide](/for-agents/guide.json): Authentication, request examples and supported workflow.
- [Skill instructions](/for-agents/SKILL.md): How to work safely on the user's story.
- [Skill download](/for-agents/skill.zip): SKILL.md, scripts/sixnine.py and scripts/connect.py. The connection helper uses the Python standard library; the API/media helper also requires httpx.

## Quick Chat: sessions and job cards
Read the guide JSON's quick_chat section and authenticated GET /v1/quick-chat/schema. POST /v1/quick-chat/sessions and preserve returned next_settings including deployment_profile_id. Read capabilities.deployment_profiles and the selected profile's generation_support[fl|ref] controls, limits and joint_cases. POST the session's turns with current expected_version, session model_id, assistant_mode=none, create_card=true and text containing the complete prompt. This inherits session materials and next_settings, creates a card without calling the disabled-by-default website assistant and does not start generation. The chat model_id is not a video deployment profile.

Alternatively POST the session's cards with explicit deployment_profile_id, recipe_id, prompt, controls, inputs and copies. Copy profile and controls from session next_settings for a new direct card, or from the current revision when revising. An omitted/null deployment_profile_id uses legacy routing, not the session's selected profile. Never remove it or choose a different profile to bypass a blocked preflight. An explicit session change uses PATCH with expected_version and complete next_settings; existing cards remain unchanged. Ordinary generation API keys do not grant GPU rental access.

Upload media through same-origin multipart POST /v1/quick-chat/sessions/{session_id}/assets with file and a stable client_asset_id; use ready asset_id values in explicit card inputs or selected session materials. Upload alone does not select a reference. The helper's upload/resume-upload commands accept --session SESSION_ID (or legacy --project, never both); never address the session's hidden project. Read the current revision and preflight it; only confirm a ready preflight within the user's authorization. The submission exposes items[].job_id for the existing shared job and its authenticated artifacts. Preserve write bodies and Idempotency-Key values when recovering uncertain responses.

This is an API workflow. Quick Chat frontend publication is a separate gate; a returned /quick-chat URL does not prove that this deployment serves that UI. Return session/card/submission/job IDs and verified download results without promising a working chat page. Direct cards do not require Google credentials or an AI Registry installation.

## Legacy quick creation and stories
For one clip, POST /v1/projects with title and workspace=freestyle. Use project.journey.reviewShotId, upload intended references, and save with shot.configure_generation. GET the shot's generation-draft; POST its generation-plans with the returned project_version as expected_version. Only a ready plan within the user's authorization can be confirmed through POST /v1/jobs with a stable Idempotency-Key. The guide JSON contains exact examples and partial-update rules. Return /freestyle?project={project_id}&entity={shot_id}; the same draft and candidates remain editable. Creating/editing a draft does not generate video.

## Authorization and live capabilities
A URL is a discovery link, not permission to edit or spend. The owner explicitly authorizes a one-time connection. Read /for-agents/connect-manifest.json, inspect /for-agents/connect.py and verify its digest before executing. The five-minute code may be handed to the Agent; the permanent PAT is generated locally and stored before exchange in Windows user DPAPI or Linux Secret Service. No internal AI Registry is required. Missing supported storage stops before exchange. Resume uncertain exchanges with the same saved connection. Manual PATs remain an advanced fallback using a process-only credential. Never put permanent keys in chat, URLs, argv or ordinary files. The only anonymous POST is /v1/agent-connect/exchange; account/business APIs and OpenAPI require authentication. The connection UI has a separate publication gate. Use only the origin supplied by the user and do not forward its credential to other origins.

After authorization, read GET /v1/agent-guide, /v1/guided-schema, /v1/capabilities and /openapi.json. Static documentation is not proof that generation is enabled. An actual plan may be blocked; do not invent successful media.

## Edit, generate, return control
Read the current project/version; use atomic guided actions with expected_version and stable Idempotency-Key. On 409 fetch and reconcile. Upload references to the same story. Inspect a generation plan's blockers/estimate before submitting within the user's authorization. Poll the original job; an unknown outcome is never a reason to issue a new paid request.

Adopt successful artifacts into the target shot and verify the saved document. Return the story/entity link and job ID. The authenticated project activity feed and job list let the user review changes. For a deliberate new take, use a new plan on the latest shot version, retain old candidates and explicitly select the chosen result. Unsaved browser drafts are never assumed to have refreshed automatically.

<p class="tag">FOR AI AGENTS · API V1</p><h1>让 AI 创作，<br>让你随时接手。</h1>
<p>把这个网站链接发给 Codex 或其他支持 API 的 Agent。一个短片可以直接用快速创作：提示词、图片、动作视频、音频和设置都保存到同一份网页草稿。需要改编剧本时，也能整理故事、章节和分镜。</p>
<div class="links"><a href="/for-agents/SKILL.md">阅读 Skill</a><a href="/for-agents/skill.zip">下载 Skill 包</a><a href="/">登录并连接 Agent</a></div>
<section class="panel"><h2 style="margin-top:0">三步开始</h2><ol><li><strong>先把链接和创作要求给 Agent。</strong>这页、Skill 和机器指南公开可读，无需登录。</li><li><strong>登录网站，明确授权一次连接。</strong>连接界面上线后，复制短时有效的连接说明给 Agent。辅助脚本在本机生成正式 Key，并通过系统凭据存储保存；无需安装我们的 AI Registry。正式 Key 不进入聊天或链接。当前页面是否提供连接按钮以实际前端发布为准；手动 API Key 是高级备用方式。</li><li><strong>回网站看结果，再继续调整。</strong>打开同一云故事，查看活动和任务；定位章节、角色或镜头，修改要求后只重做需要的部分。旧候选保留，选中哪一版由你决定。</li></ol>
<small>分享链接只用于发现功能。写入需要账户授权；生成还取决于当前服务是否启用、输入是否合格和可用预算。此页不代表 GPU 已上线。</small></section>
<h2>可直接发给 Agent 的任务示例</h2><p>“阅读这个网站的 /for-agents 使用指南。用我已配置的凭据，为这个广告想法创建一个快速视频草稿，把我的图片、动作视频和音频放到对应位置，返回网页让我继续修改。生成前核对可用能力、阻塞原因和费用；只有在我已经授权的范围内才提交。结果先放候选，不覆盖我已选择的版本。”</p><p>如果你在做短剧，可以要求 Agent 建立章节、角色和分镜；同一份故事也能在快速创作中单独调整某个镜头。</p>
<h2>Agent 的调用顺序</h2><ol>''' + steps + '''</ol>
<h2>用对话和任务卡创作</h2><p>机器指南的 <code>quick_chat</code> 和认证后的 <code>/v1/quick-chat/schema</code> 提供完整示例：创建会话 → 上传素材 → 创建任务卡 → 预检 → 明确确认 → 查询原任务和下载结果。外部 Agent 可直接提交完整提示词，使用 <code>assistant_mode=none</code>、<code>create_card=true</code>，继承会话素材及 <code>next_settings</code>；网站聊天助手默认关闭，不影响直接创建卡片，也不会因此自动生成。</p><p>直接创建或修改卡片时，明确携带已选 <code>deployment_profile_id</code>、生成方式和参数；新卡片读取会话设置，修改已有卡片读取原版本。省略配方不会继承会话选择，而是走旧路由。先查配方专属能力与限制，不为绕过阻塞而换模型。普通生成 Key 不具有租 GPU 权限。</p><p>会话素材须通过同源 <code>/v1/quick-chat/sessions/{session_id}/assets</code> 上传，不操作隐藏项目。辅助脚本的 upload/resume-upload 支持 --session，会话与原有 --project 参数互斥。Quick Chat 网页有独立发布步骤，返回的 <code>/quick-chat</code> 地址不保证当前部署已能打开；先返回会话、卡片、任务 ID 和经核验的下载结果。用户不需要安装我们的 AI Registry。</p>
<h2>原有快速草稿与故事接口</h2><p>使用本人全部项目范围和 projects:create 权限。为每次新建保存唯一的幂等键；重试原请求沿用原键。返回的 project.journey.reviewShotId 是单镜头 ID。随后用 shot.configure_generation 保存生成设置；创建草稿不会启动 GPU。</p><pre>''' + example + '''</pre><p>完整的纯文字、参考素材、预检、提交和候选采用示例见<a href="/for-agents/guide.json">机器可读指南</a>。</p>
<h2>真实边界</h2><p>网站公开说明与已授权 API 文档分开。认证后的 <code>/v1/agent-guide</code>、<code>/v1/guided-schema</code>、<code>/v1/capabilities</code> 和 <code>/openapi.json</code> 是调用依据。若生成计划返回阻塞，保留草稿并说明原因；不要把演示素材当成生成成功。</p>
<p>网站聊天助手默认关闭；不支持未配置的图像/音乐/Marble 生成、团队成员共享权限或服务器媒体 ZIP。外部 Agent 可以自行编写完整提示词并保存为任务卡或故事草稿；已有 API Key 不会扩大这些能力。</p>
<p><small>Skill 包只包含 SKILL.md、scripts/sixnine.py 和 scripts/connect.py；连接脚本只需 Python 标准库与受支持的系统凭据存储，API/媒体辅助脚本还需要 httpx。你也可以直接使用同源 HTTP API，无需安装 Skill。下载不会自动安装或授权。</small></p></main></body></html>'''
