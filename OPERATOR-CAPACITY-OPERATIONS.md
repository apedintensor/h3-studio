# Operating the GPU capacity console

Delivery: [E3 #71](https://github.com/inkseq/h3-studio/issues/71). See [the contract](OPERATOR-CAPACITY-CONTRACT.md) for authority and compatibility. This guide describes implemented configuration; it is not a production release or a new spending authorization.

## What is available

The canonical frontend route is `/operator`. An explicitly allowlisted operator uses a normal authenticated browser session; ordinary accounts and generation API keys cannot access the rental controls. The page manages provider selection, host count, GPUs per host, a deployment profile and FL2VA/Ref2VA mode, approved hardware filters, a latest stopping time, global capacity limits, drain and safe stop. Lium remains the default provider; Targon needs its own protected binding and cleanup authority. An accepted start is asynchronous. The page shows provider observations, runtime stages, controller freshness, immutable operation IDs and actionable blockers.

The initial catalog contains:

| Profile | Tested host topology | Component strategy | Generation evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pruned Rank8 INT8 | 1 × RTX 5090, 32 GB VRAM | INT8 backbone / INT8 text encoder / INT8 VAE, SDPA, low RAM | 8 matched FL/REF cases |
| Unpruned 33B INT8 | 2 × RTX PRO 6000 Server, 96 GB each | INT8 backbone / BF16 text encoder / FP16 VAE, SDPA | 7 matched FL/REF cases |
| Unpruned 33B BF16 v2 | Same two-card PRO host | BF16 backbone / BF16 text encoder / FP16 VAE, split QKV | 7 matched FL/REF cases |
| Pruned Rank8 INT8 PRO qualification profile | 1 × PRO 6000 requested; hardware acceptance required | Same pruned INT8 weights/runtime as the 5090 profile | Fixed candidate cases; no inherited PRO measurements |

The unpruned PRO profiles use two independent GPU slots of the **same** selected mode/profile on one host; the pruned PRO candidate uses one slot. Neither is tensor parallelism or two independent machines. Create separate hosts for different modes/profiles. The experimental mixed-precision comparison on one host does not establish a mixed-profile production topology.

All measured videos use 124 native frames at 24 fps (about 5.17 s). The catalog records 480p/768p and 20/50-step **joint cases**, not every possible combination. Reference cases accept only the tested combinations and bounds: at most one image, one silent 56-frame/24-fps video and one independent 2–5.2 s audio reference. PRO FL measurements require both endpoint images. Additional controls or combinations need separate qualification; this does not claim full H3 control parity.

Example historical task totals, excluding queue/VM start/download: 5090 FL first+last at 480p/20 steps 96.791 s; 5090 REF image+video+audio at 480p/20 steps 161.568 s; PRO INT8 same REF case 151.950 s; PRO BF16 same REF case 193.664 s. These are observations, not completion guarantees. Full samples, source revisions and input roles are in `deploy/wangp/profiles/*.json` and the linked measurement evidence.

### RTX 5090 rental filter policy

The catalog defaults are **96 GiB RAM, 128 GiB free disk and 200 Mbps advertised download bandwidth**. The disk and bandwidth values relax the original 250 GiB / 500 Mbps pilot filters to widen eligible inventory. They are derived operating policy, not newly measured hardware minima. The existing unpruned PRO 6000 filters remain unchanged.

The [original 5090 proposal](https://github.com/apedintensor/h3-studio/pull/68) used conservative admission; the [completed 5090 pilot](https://github.com/apedintensor/h3-studio/pull/69) ran on 105 GiB actual cgroup RAM. Its runtime still requires 96 GiB effective available RAM, accounting for reclaimable clean file cache, and 28 GiB free VRAM. A 64 GiB host has not been qualified. The [PRO comparison](https://github.com/apedintensor/h3-studio/pull/70) used a separate 279 GiB shared host and does not establish a smaller 5090 RAM requirement.

Pinned 5090 files total **51,898,376,278 bytes (48.33 GiB)** for one mode and **72,956,051,066 bytes (67.95 GiB)** for both modes. Current operator nodes prepare one selected mode and reuse the pinned image's installed environment. For a split rental, [Lium's allocation rules](https://docs.lium.io/pod-users/create-pod#-of-gpus-when-gpu-splitting-is-on) divide the pod's disk share between the `/root` volume (two thirds) and container storage (one third). A 128 GiB pod share therefore provides about 85 GiB for `/root/sixnine-cache/models`, leaving about 37 GiB beyond one mode's weights, before temporary files and outputs. It is not 128 GiB of model-cache space. The downloader checks missing-file bytes plus 10 GiB free headroom on the actual cache filesystem and limits its separate cache to 1 GiB. This is a sizing calculation, not a successful run on a 128 GiB allocation; a different image, both-mode cache or environment installation needs its own sizing check.

At a sustained 200 Mbps, the one-mode payload alone would take about **34.6 minutes**; both modes would take **48.6 minutes**, before setup and verification. Advertised provider bandwidth is not measured Hugging Face throughput or an SLA. The lower filter accepts a cold-start latency tradeoff; bootstrap, task-admission and supplier-deadline checks remain in force. Operators must allow sufficient authorized startup time.

Catalog changes do not update protected live provider manifests or immutable deployment bindings automatically. Prepare a matching replacement configuration through the approved release process before using these filters; existing attempts retain their original configuration. These metadata changes do not alter model files, runtime settings or engine-manifest digests.

For this filter-only activation, retain each old binding and its provider manifest; disable the old binding only for new starts. Give the successor a new `binding_id` and immutable provider-manifest path, setting `minimum_disk_gib: 128` / `min_disk_gib: 128` and `min_download_mbps: 200` consistently in the manifest and binding. Preserve `configuration_id`, pool, model/engine/recipe, source hashes, RAM/VRAM, GPU count, price, budget accounts and original expiry/TTL. No generation-policy rewrite or source-package rebuild is necessary solely for these hardware filters. The old binding fingerprint remains unchanged because only its `enabled` flag changes. Do not reload API/controller configuration until the existing protected release barrier proves no owned processes or in-flight obligations will be lost; unresolved restart recovery remains #60. No live configuration is changed by publishing this guide.

Use RAM/disk requirements for the rented pod's proportional share, not the whole host's advertised totals. An eight-GPU host with enough total RAM may still fail the single-GPU requirement. Provider minimum rental counts also apply. Looser disk/network filters do not guarantee that a qualifying one-GPU pod is currently available, and must never trigger a silent switch to four/eight GPUs or a lower RAM allocation.

## Local product review

From this backend checkout, using the existing Python environment:

```powershell
python tools/run_operator_preview.py --frontend C:/absolute/path/to/frontend/build --port 8897
```

This preview uses an isolated SQLite database and loopback-only test authentication. `superdan` can review the console; `supervan` remains an ordinary creator. It exposes real routes and the real catalog, but no provider bindings, inventory credentials, paid controller or generation. A blocked start here is intentional and is never reported as a running GPU.

## Provision the controller configuration once

Use the existing platform database and budget/instance ledgers on the chosen controller host. Do not copy the preview database into production. Do not reset a budget to make the page green, and do not run two competing legacy/manual controllers for the same pool. Existing accepted jobs and legacy pools retain their route until their obligations are reconciled.

1. Build immutable small source sets on the release host with `python tools/build_operator_sources.py --output /absolute/new/sources`. This creates each catalog profile/mode/slot directory plus `index.json`; it installs nothing and does not download models. A repeated destination is rejected. The index supplies exact hashes, profile IDs, manifest digests, mode and slot topology.
2. For each approved profile/mode, prepare its protected provider manifest. Lium uses `LiumManifest`, an explicit template, server-side selection and the tested GPU count, with approved VRAM/RAM/disk/download/price/country filters and the existing public SSH key. Targon uses the separate fixed-resource contract below. No private key or API key belongs in either JSON. Unsupported filters are rejected instead of pretending to enforce them.
3. Create a protected registry `{ "schema_version": 1, "bindings": [...] }`. Each binding follows `studio_platform.operator_capacity.DeploymentBinding`: exact profile, model, engine digest, pool/configuration, functional recipe, existing scope/budget account IDs, full-host hourly cap, full-window reservation, expiry, supported TTL range and `enabled`. Its `boot` has exactly `provider_manifest_file`, `source_dirs` and `source_sha256`; arrays contain one distinct directory/hash set per GPU from the source index. Keep disabled retired bindings until their instances and invoices are reconciled. A changed binding is a replacement, not an edit to a running attempt.
4. Create a protected runtime file with `schema_version: 1`, absolute `registry_file`, existing `work_dir`, existing `ssh_key_file`, `known_hosts_file`, and `port_start` (reserve 1,024 unused local ports). The exact runtime Python is `/venv/main/bin/python`. Host-key trust defaults to false. `credential_source: central_registry` reuses the selected `lium/lium--rig-root` or `targon/targon--rig-root` identity. A Linux service uses `credential_source: aws_runtime`: existing top-level `secret_arn` / `secret_version_id` identify Lium; `provider_credentials.targon` contains the equivalent pinned Targon references. A Targon-only service needs no Lium reference. No credential values, new dotenv file or copied loader.
5. Configure an execution-profile file `{ "schema_version": 1, "policies": [...] }` using `studio_platform.execution_policy.validate_policy`. Each entry binds one profile and one mode to the same pool/config/model/engine digest. Use `execution_profiles.tested_envelope(profile_id, mode)` as a conservative starting scope, `output_delivery: native-frames-v1`, and `qualification.profile: queued-task-first-v1` with `status: runtime_required`. Set reservation amounts, expected runtime, account IDs and expiry from the actual authorized operating policy. An experiment timing or catalog entry does not authorize a policy. Keep the legacy policy separate.
6. Mount the source/config files read-only into API and controller at the same absolute paths. Only the controller receives writable work/known-hosts and existing platform state, plus the existing SSH credential file read-only. The API does not need the private SSH key, controller work directory, cloud role or provider network access. API and controller must share the **same database**, absolute configuration references and release. API environment: `H3_OPERATOR_RUNTIME_CONFIG`, `SIXNINE_EXECUTION_PROFILES_FILE`, and `SIXNINE_OPERATOR_CAPACITY_OWNERS=superdan`. Do not simultaneously set `H3_OPERATOR_CAPACITY_REGISTRY`. Existing authentication, generation/backend, storage, queue and budget settings remain explicit. `superdan` is the existing platform account/session owner; this code does not map a Cognito subject to an account. Ordinary API keys have no rental permission.

`operator_runtime.create_registry(path, repository=repo)` validates source hashes, topology, model identities, filters and price/reservation using protected metadata. It never constructs a provider or requires private path mounts. `create_controller(path)` additionally validates controller-private paths, but does not fetch credentials or call a provider during construction. Existing test fixtures illustrate schemas, but contain synthetic identities and are **not deployable configuration**. Linux configuration files must be operator-owned, without group/world write or world access; linked paths are rejected.

New operator allocations pin SSH keys under `<work_dir>/boot/<intent_id>/ssh/known_hosts`, shared by all slots on that exact provider instance. A protected `ssh-host-identity.json` records the supplier, intent and instance, then binds the first public key before authentication. An immutable selection anchor under `<work_dir>/ssh-host-selections/<intent_id>.json` is committed first, outside the disposable boot subtree. An anchor with missing boot records blocks fresh trust even if the entire instance boot directory was lost or recreated. The existing `trust_first_host_key` switch still controls first trust; it is not enabled implicitly. The bound key remains authoritative on controller restart and on a supplier endpoint alias. Missing/changed bytes, a replacement key, identity conflicts or partial pin commits require review; restarting does not renew first trust. Never remove these receipts to unblock an instance or disable SSH host-key checks.

Allocations with existing slot directories retain their original configured global `known_hosts_file` and historical bootstrap identity. Their protected selection receipt makes that compatibility choice sticky. Do not delete, rewrite or silently migrate the shared historical keys. Scoped residue, a bootstrap identity already declaring scoped keys, or a conflicting original instance cannot be treated as legacy migration evidence. This source behavior is not an operational recovery script or proof of arbitrary host-loss recovery. Exceptional recovery of an already blocked allocation remains separately reviewed and preserves the original keys and obligations.

After exact-version release and protected-host approval, run the existing controller entry point:

```text
python -m studio_platform.operator_controller --factory studio_platform.operator_runtime:create_controller --config /absolute/protected/runtime.json --enabled
```

This does not initialize global capacity or budget accounts. The existing global capacity gate must already be configured. In the console, set versioned manual limits within that authority. Then select an approved binding, refresh availability, preview, and explicitly confirm a start. Editing a hardware filter beyond a configured binding is rejected until a matching trusted binding exists; the browser cannot invent arbitrary launch commands.

For the isolated AWS controller container, use the trusted factory `studio_platform.operator_runtime:create_controller_from_stdin` instead. The protected host helper loads only the configured pinned Secrets Manager versions and passes credentials over private stdin, then closes the pipe and loaders. Lium-only configuration retains the bounded `{secret_arn, version_id, payload}` envelope; Targon uses schema 2 with a `credentials` map whose keys exactly match configured providers. The factory validates each envelope through its provider-specific in-memory loader, without AWS access or workstation fallback. Do not paste or put this envelope in a command, file, log or environment variable. Keep the API on its internal networks and the controller on its approved database/egress networks; neither needs EC2 metadata access.

Availability is an observation in the existing database, not a second rental ledger. The controller performs one read-only provider inventory probe at a time outside its lifecycle loop. The API accepts a result only for the exact immutable binding fingerprint, a matching current controller heartbeat no older than 30 seconds, and an inventory observation no older than 120 seconds. Missing/stale/unavailable inventory blocks previews and new confirmations; an exact idempotent replay still returns its original operation. Prices remain approved ceilings, not live quotes. A slow inventory request cannot delay provider lifetime checks or collection.

Before enabling a new binding, verify the existing global `capacity_gate`, its pool limits, and referenced budget scopes. Initialize only genuinely new pools under the approved policy. Changing global/operator maxima does not reset spent/reserved money or settle earlier work. Rental reservations use the binding's infrastructure scope; generation reservations must also match each creator's owner/project scope. An owner-scoped `superdan` budget cannot fund `supervan` jobs merely because both use the same GPU. Keep unresolved historical reservations until settlement evidence exists.

The controller writes a small atomic `controller-status.json` in its private work directory after successful ticks and before a clean shutdown return. It binds `runtime_config_sha256` to `repository.request_hash` of the raw parsed runtime JSON, plus controller identity, observation time and lifecycle state. `shutdown_complete` and `local_connections_released` describe local collectors/tunnels only; `cloud_removal_confirmed` and `billing_settled` remain false. A host release barrier must combine this receipt with the exact container/image/configuration/exit status and a fresh database obligation check. A receipt alone does not authorize service replacement.

### Targon VM preparation and independent cleanup

The explicit pruned PRO profile is `h3-pruned-rank8-int8-pro6000-quanto-int8-vae-int8-sdpa-p4-lowram-v1`. Selecting it changes hardware identity while retaining the pruned weights, precision and fixed request controls. Its candidate cases are not historical measurements. Select and preview this profile explicitly; an old 5090 recommendation that only changes provider/GPU does not acquire the new profile's binding.

Prepare a `TargonManifest` with exact configuration/model, organization, resource/image names, registered SSH-key IDs, GPU/slot count, whole-node hourly cap, maximum lifetime and approval expiry. Both `allow_preflight_only_price_cap` and `allow_controller_lifetime` must be explicit approvals. The binding uses `launch.provider: targon`, `offer_id: resource_name`, `image_id: image_name` and an empty region. RAM/disk floors and the per-GPU price cap must match; bandwidth/CPU filters and country restrictions are unsupported. Reserve the whole approved lifetime, not an assumed eventual invoice.

The protected host runtime also requires `cleanup_guard_dir: /srv/sixnine/targon-guard`. Prepare a separate restarting guardian service from `tools/targon_cleanup_guard.py` with root-controlled `config.json`, receipts and heartbeat. Its configuration binds the same pinned Targon credential reference, organization, allowed resources/images and original time window. The controller gets the guard root read-only and only `requests/` writable by UID 10001; the API gets neither mount. The host helper hashes the guard configuration and used provider-import metadata into its preparation receipt. Guardian health/acknowledgement must be fresh before deployment and remain current for execution admission.

An approved Ubuntu 24.04 VM uses the `ubuntu` SSH identity and fixed noninteractive sudo commands. The hash-bound source bundle supplies `targon_prepare.py`, which verifies the original instance/deadline and exact pruned PRO profile, installs the pinned Python/core runtime requirements, and records the observed environment before handing off to the existing model download/bootstrap. It does not alter the GPU driver, rent another VM or submit a smoke video. This is automatic preparation after an authorized start; it is not a claim of a previously qualified image or fully measured dependency environment. Setup failure or ambiguous process ownership keeps the original journal and requires reconciliation.

The guardian supplies an external deadline, not Targon-native TTL. Loss of its host or provider connectivity can prevent cleanup; stale/degraded proof blocks new execution, and removal/billing remain separately reconciled. Deadline cleanup can interrupt unfinished work, so generation admission retains task/collection margins and never extends the original window. Do not interpret provider `running`, preparation completion or a healthy heartbeat as successful inference.

## Start, dispatch and stop

Lium publishes hourly rates but bills per second: pod hourly rate × billable seconds / 3,600, without rounding up to a minute or hour. Billing begins at the deploy request, includes provisioning, and stops at the removal request under the documented lifecycle. This was checked against [official Billing](https://docs.lium.io/pod-users/billing) on 2026-10-10. A request whose acknowledgment is unknown does not prove that billing stopped. Final settlement still uses the exact pod's supplier statement, not a local elapsed-time estimate or dashboard balance.

The current adapter sends an integer `termination_hours` scheduling parameter. Its 3,780-second minimum request window leaves the existing submission/queue margins; it is a client scheduling constraint, not a Lium billing minimum. The requested TTL is an upper stopping bound, not guaranteed uptime. The preview uses hourly rate × chosen seconds / 3,600 rounded only to the accounting microUSD unit; the protected binding may reserve a larger conservative full scheduling cap. Neither amount is an actual charge. The controller records the supplier's verified safe deadline and only shortens the original ledger deadline. Admission checks that deadline plus task and collection margin. Unavailable or stale lifetime proof blocks new dispatch while an already bound task can reconcile/collect. The original budget reservation remains until settlement evidence exists.

Each physical GPU gets its own immutable GPU UUID, private runtime directory, HTTP port, source manifest, worker identity, tunnel and process receipt. Shared downloads use a bounded cache lock. Bootstrap validates the exact prepared WanGP revision and dependency set before registering capacity. It does not run separate synthetic smoke videos. The first accepted user job supplies real generation evidence after output validation and persistence.

Quick Chat selects the deployment profile and FL/REF mode. Saving or revising a card preserves that choice. The API uses optional top-level `deployment_profile_id` on generation plans; omitting it preserves legacy routing. A ready worker must match profile-derived model, configuration, engine digest and recipe. Failure to find matching capacity is visible; a different ready model never substitutes silently. A manual start does not itself submit a video.

Drain stops new claims. Safe stop also waits for bound jobs, output collection and positive per-slot idle proof before removal. An uncertain rental keeps its original identity and reservation. A controller restart does not blindly spawn a replacement for an unobserved child: unknown process ownership is reported and needs recovery under [#60](https://github.com/inkseq/h3-studio/issues/60). Do not restart a controller with live owned processes as a normal way of changing profiles. Lium supplier TTL and the separately armed Targon guardian have different failure boundaries; neither settles invoices or retrieves lost files.

SIGINT/SIGTERM initiate a graceful controller drain: no new rentals, retained original node identities and continued reconciliation/collection. The process closes its local tunnels only after proving that its owned children and bound jobs are finished; this is not a supplier-removal or billing-settlement receipt. The default 900-second grace threshold reports attention rather than forcibly killing collectors. A service manager must not impose a shorter forced-kill timeout (`TimeoutStopSec=infinity` or an explicitly reviewed recovery policy). Forced termination, host loss and adopting a previous process's unknown fleet remain #60; do not claim this orderly shutdown path proves crash recovery.

## Read-only multi-provider inventory

The separate `studio_platform.capacity_scan` sampler performs only bounded GETs
and writes allowlisted observations to `platform_capacity_market_observations`.
It does not run the rental controller, alter budgets/policies, or initialize
capacity. The API/worker remains a cache reader without provider egress or keys.
The normal application schema migration creates the additive table first.

The configured operator controller refreshes both provider-wide market caches
asynchronously every 30 seconds, with at most one bounded read per supplier in
flight. Lium uses its existing approved in-memory loader; Targon stock uses the
public keyless endpoint. Each result is published independently, so a supplier
timeout cannot hide the other result or hold the controller lifecycle loop. These
full-stock observations remain separate from per-binding admission probes.
Failed reads replace availability with a safe error; controller stopping stops
new reads and late publication. Neither path gives provider credentials or egress
to the API or changes rental/budget authority. A Targon-only controller still
refreshes Targon; without an approved Lium identity, Lium reports an error rather
than loading another account implicitly.

The console's single refresh action POSTs `{}` to
`/v1/operator/capacity/market-refreshes`. It writes a coalesced wake-up marker for
both suppliers to the existing cache payload, preserving each previous observation
and timestamp. The controller handles it on the next tick; the console polls the
cache for up to 60 seconds and displays each supplier's pending/completed/failed
state separately. A controller that is absent or cannot publish produces
`inventory_refresh_timeout`. Refreshing does not create a capacity command,
reservation, lease, schema migration, GPU start or provider credential copy.

Expand the console's current filters to inspect their sources: profile RAM/disk/
CPU admission floors, catalogue bandwidth/price guidance, and protected binding
limits for the exact model/mode/provider/GPU count. The `excluded` projection keeps
bounded known-small or GPU-edition-mismatched offers instead of making filtered
stock look like a failed supplier API. Lium advertised 94 GiB is not 94 GiB usable:
the existing max(4 GiB, 1%) host reserve yields 90 GiB, below the current 96 GiB
admission floor. A generic Targon PRO 6000 can be pruned-compatible while its
edition and Base-model deployment remain unqualified. No field editor in the
browser can override these server-owned conditions.

Runtime profile metadata lives in `deploy/wangp/profiles/*.json`; protected
deployment filters come from the runtime file selected by
`H3_OPERATOR_RUNTIME_CONFIG`, its `registry_file`, and the paired provider
manifests. Inspect safe projected values before changing policy. Filter-only
successors within the enforced profile floors use the existing replacement
configuration process above and retain immutable prior bindings/receipts. They
do not require another model generation merely to change bandwidth, price or
permitted disk policy. Changing the model, mode, weights, engine identity,
admission envelope or GPU topology still requires its own qualification. Do not
silently lower RAM or reinterpret catalogue guidance as protected acceptance.

For an already configured service environment, the explicit sampler command is:

```text
python -m studio_platform.capacity_scan --providers targon
```

`--once` performs one observation round. The default loop refreshes every 30
seconds; each supplier has bounded transport/body limits and no automatic
HTTP retries. Targon inventory uses the public pinned
`https://api.targon.com/tha/v3/inventory` endpoint and requires no account key.
`--providers lium targon` also uses the existing explicit central
`lium/lium--rig-root` identity on this workstation. A Linux service must supply
its existing approved in-memory Lium loader to `scan_lium`; do not copy a DPAPI
vault or fall back to another account. The standalone default CLI does not
invent that host credential bridge. Targon rental credentials are not loaded.

Local opt-in preview (generation, rentals and assistant remain disabled):

```text
python tools/run_operator_preview.py --frontend <absolute-canonical-series-directory> --port 8898 --data <isolated-preview-directory> --scan-inventory lium targon
```

Without `--scan-inventory`, the preview still performs no provider requests.
Source changes do not install a production sampler, publish the frontend or
restart an active capacity controller. Track unified-controller activation in
[#110](https://github.com/inkseq/h3-studio/issues/110); historical beta lifecycle
follow-up remains [#86](https://github.com/inkseq/h3-studio/issues/86). Deploy the
reviewed controller, API and frontend through the existing exact-version release
process; this refresh path uses the existing table without a schema change. Do not
replace an active controller just to refresh stock. Preserve old ledgers and
the pending controller recovery work in #60. A scanner error leaves a visible
failed/stale observation, never fake zero stock or a second rental intent.

Provider sources: [Targon inventory](https://docs.targon.com/api/inventory),
[workloads](https://docs.targon.com/api/workloads),
[virtual machines](https://docs.targon.com/guides/virtual-machines).
Public listing/units, authenticated allocation, runtime readiness, validated
generation and final billing are separate evidence. Keep dated live receipts
on the delivery issue rather than using this guide as a deployment status log.

### Protected AWS Targon stock sampler

This separately managed helper remains an optional standalone stock path. After
the unified controller is accepted, its own recurring Targon scan supplies the
same market projection and this separate timer is normally unnecessary. Preserve
old helper receipts and manage any installed timer explicitly through its scoped
commands; an application merge alone does not install, stop or replace it.

The reviewed host helper is `deploy/platform/targon_market.py`. Its separately
approved, root-owned installation path is `/opt/sixnine-release/targon_market.py`,
beside the existing release helper; an application source merge does not install
or enable it. It uses the approved current application image and existing database
secret, without provider credentials, GPU authority, runtime mounts or schema
initialization. The normal release must have installed the inventory table first.

After exact-version host approval, run each step separately and check its receipt:

```text
python3 /opt/sixnine-release/targon_market.py prepare
python3 /opt/sixnine-release/targon_market.py once
python3 /opt/sixnine-release/targon_market.py start
python3 /opt/sixnine-release/targon_market.py status
```

`prepare` only renders configuration and pins the approved release, helper,
manifest, compose/site files and archive-proven image identities in the protected
`/srv/sixnine/targon-market` directory. OCI index and container config IDs may differ
only when the approved single-image archive binds them. `once` performs a real
public Targon inventory GET and writes a bounded normalized database observation;
success requires a fresh successful observation, not merely process exit zero.
`start` requires that acceptance receipt and enables the scoped systemd timer,
which repeats every 30 seconds. Each sample rechecks the protected pin and live
application identity without decompressing the image archive again.

Use `python3 /opt/sixnine-release/targon_market.py stop` to disable this timer and
stop only its exactly named, image-bound and pin-labelled sampler container. It
does not stop the rental controller or cleanup guardian. `cleanup` is the same
scoped container cleanup used by the systemd unit after each sample; it retains
its own identity checks even after an application release changes. A changed
release/helper invalidates sampling. An existing preparation is never overwritten:
stop and reconcile the sampler, preserve its old protected receipts, then review
and prepare the new exact version. This guide grants no production activation or
rental authority.

## Acceptance before calling it operational

Offline coverage establishes permissions, idempotency, accounting, slot isolation, native output delivery and profile matching. Release packaging includes the profile catalog and fingerprints it for both API/worker compatibility. A code merge does not publish the frontend or enable a rental service.

The remaining live gate for E3 is: approve the local UI, bind the actual host configuration and unchanged ledgers, release the exact API/frontend/controller versions, start one requested profile from the page, submit a Quick Chat/Agent job, retrieve validated video/audio, then observe drain/removal/settlement. Record exact receipts on #71; track broader mode/recovery/image qualification under #22, #29, #60, #61 and public proof under #16. Never mark those complete merely because the catalog lists historical native runs.
