# Pinned WanGP H3 FL2VA execution recipe

This is the first deliberately bounded **BF16 Base, 50-step** path, not full H3
control parity or a measured performance claim. The business ledger, leases,
owner isolation, attempts, budgets, media validation and publication remain in
the existing platform. The upstream Session is private to a one-slot host.

## Reproduction and qualification status

- Source: `deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP@0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea`.
- Components: `manifest.json` pins the HF repository revision, exact filenames,
  precision, byte sizes and SHA-256 (LFS), or Git blob SHA-1 (small JSON files).
  Metadata was read from the pinned [HF model API](https://huggingface.co/api/models/DeepBeepMeep/MiniMax-H3/revision/adc81ccb71352192214d83d5fafb9487e860be39?blobs=true)
  on 2026-10-07. This is source/metadata evidence, not proof of installed weights.
- Model files total **124,300,443,428 bytes**. Transformer: 66,280,486,944;
  Qwen layer-50 BF16: 51,506,305,568; video VAE FP16: 5,207,806,512;
  audio VAE FP32: 605,429,308; latent upscaler BF16: 690,592,992;
  the balance is tokenizer/configuration files. Disk size is not a VRAM estimate.
- `runtime-recipe.json` is a candidate installation recipe, **not a complete
  dependency lock or a qualified container image**. `runtime_digest` identifies
  the exact upstream requirements source, not a fabricated installed-image hash.
  Transitive wheels, OS packages, driver compatibility, image digest and measured
  memory/cold-start/inference results must be recorded on the authorized host.
- The candidate uses Python 3.11.14 and PyTorch 2.10.0/CUDA 12.8 wheels. The
  [pinned Dockerfile lines 1–43](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/Dockerfile#L1-L43)
  specifies these Torch wheels; the [manual guide lines 5–25](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/docs/INSTALLATION.md#L5-L25)
  recommends Python 3.11.14 and a different CUDA 13.0 recipe for modern RTX.
  These are documented alternatives, not evidence of a universal CUDA minimum.
  This first recipe selects dense SDPA and does not require building optional
  Sage/Sol kernels. Do not substitute CUDA wheels silently to make a host pass.

## Explicit startup interfaces

### Platform cold-start integration

The existing production controller selects `execution_backend=wangp-worker` and
the frozen `engine_manifest_digest`; it still owns the original PostgreSQL
capacity, rental and job ledger. Do not start a second controller or reuse a
Comfy approval for this runtime. The cold path uses the real queued-task profile;
boot readiness never fabricates an inference result.

The initial host-managed rollout uses a separately staged, root-owned dependency
archive at `gpu-scaler/public-source/wangp-dependencies.tar.gz`. The host verifies
its hash from the small runtime configuration and mounts it read-only into the
CPU controller. The controller streams it in bounded chunks to the GPU's
`/root/sixnine-cache`, resumes only a matching prefix, and publishes it only after
the complete hash matches. Large wheels and weights are never inserted into the
controller's in-memory source map. Other bootstrap package modes are manual
interfaces, not alternative enabled production configurations.

The PyTorch template starts bootstrap through `/opt/conda/bin/python`; its
observed Python patch version must match the captured lock. The private client
configuration requires the original 32-hex `runtime_incarnation`. Missing/null
identity cannot configure a production slot. Same-instance SSH recovery keeps
the listener and worker identities while checking the retained host key; full
controller-process restart recovery is a separate C2 gate.

Host installation is separate from the application release. Install the reviewed
`deploy/platform/gpu_scaler.py`, `deploy/platform/release.py` and the pure
`studio_platform/service_policy.py` in their existing protected host locations;
the application bundle does not automatically replace `/opt/sixnine-release`.
Archive a verified finished lifecycle before constructing new inputs, preserve
the SSH identity and database, and never reset accounting or old approvals to
make the new configuration pass.

### Package preparation and one-shot bootstrap

`package_tool.py` is an explicit build command, never an application import hook.
`prepare --upstream-root CHECKOUT --output NEW_DIRECTORY --base-image IMAGE@sha256:DIGEST`
runs on Linux x86-64/Python 3.11.x and records the exact patch version. It checks the upstream revision and requirements
hash, resolves the complete upstream import surface plus `runtime-host.in`, builds
a wheelhouse, verifies an offline hash-locked installation in a fresh venv, and
records every installed Python distribution, system package, source file and wheel.
The resulting `wangp-dependencies.tar.gz` can be several GB; stream it to the GPU
host separately. Never put it or the 124 GB model files in the controller's
in-memory small-source map. Failed resolution does not produce a qualified lock.

`--wheelhouse EXISTING_DIRECTORY` reuses already acquired wheels offline. Retain
the exact additional/updated native `.deb` files and pass `--system-debs DIRECTORY`
(default `/var/cache/apt/archives`). Their package/version/architecture, sizes and
hashes are included in the environment lock and artifact. Bootstrap verifies these
archives and uses offline `dpkg --install`; it never runs apt update/latest on a
production cold start. Missing dependency closure fails the install. Python
distributions must match the whole lock exactly. OS packages listed in the lock
must be present at their exact recorded versions; extra provider packages such as
SSH may exist and are recorded in the observed receipt. They cannot replace or
upgrade a recorded library silently.

For a pre-existing provider image, the concrete sequence is:

1. Run its exact observed image digest locally, add required native packages,
   and prepare a fresh isolated venv using the retained wheels and `.deb` files.
   Capture Python, wheel and native-package identities on that target image.
2. Bind a new manifest and stage the protected package/identity. The controller
   must pin and verify the provider template's actual Docker digest separately.
3. On the authorized GPU, the bootstrap installs that artifact and invokes
   `probe_gpu.py` in a bounded child process before downloading models. It verifies
   source/environment, real CUDA visibility, and imports `wgp` plus the H3 pipeline
   with outbound socket connections refused. Import failure names the missing
   module in the protected `gpu-import.json`; it does not auto-install anything.
4. Keep this frozen environment identity for the explicit model/bootstrap and
   first accepted task. `imports_verified` is not inference qualification. A
   dependency repair creates a new captured lock/manifest before another lease.

`Dockerfile.build` pins an official Python base and captures the packages actually
installed by its initial build. Its apt operation alone is not a reproducible
lock. Retain the resulting image digest. `Dockerfile.runtime` installs the recorded
wheels offline on that exact base, without starting a server or fetching models.
A container image/venv installation still does not prove NVIDIA driver support or
successful H3 inference. A different provider template requires its own explicit
environment capture and new manifest identity; the builder's Debian package list
is not a universal requirement for every GPU provider.

`source-bundle --output NEW_FILE` creates only the explicitly enumerated private
host Python files, under 16 MiB. No credentials, media, settings, weights, runtime
state or dependency wheel is included. `bind-manifest --manifest manifest.json
--environment-lock ENVIRONMENT_JSON --image IMAGE@sha256:DIGEST --output NEW_FILE`
creates a new identity bound to the measured full lock. It does not overwrite the
historical source-only candidate and leaves inference qualification false.

The controller stages the four small files (`wangp-bootstrap.py`,
`wangp-runtime.json`, `wangp-manifest.json`, `wangp-package.tar.gz`) and, for the
archive mode, streams the separately hash-bound `wangp-dependencies.tar.gz`.
Copy `runtime-config.template.json` and fill measured hashes/paths; placeholder
values deliberately fail validation. Exactly one dependency source is selected:
an already-staged local artifact, an unsigned HTTPS artifact URL, or an immutable
image's `prepared_root` containing `dependencies/` and `venv/`. URL credentials and
query parameters are refused. API credentials and model credentials are not
accepted by this bootstrap.

The explicit remote command is:

```sh
python wangp-bootstrap.py --config wangp-runtime.json --slot-key APPROVED_INTENT_ID --token-file /protected/private-runtime-token
```

The token remains a protected mode-0600 file and is used only in process memory.
The bootstrap's exclusive `wangp-bootstrap-started.json` is separate from the
controller's start identity. A repeated invocation returns `reconcile_required`
without changing status, launching a second process, or resetting the journal.
After downloading pinned public components and verifying every size/hash, the
bootstrap starts the existing launcher on loopback only. It then checks the
authenticated `/v1/readiness` response for the exact manifest, slot and idle state.
`setup-status.json` records phases and safe error codes; successful readiness has
`state=ready`, `runtime_verified=true`, source/manifest identity, observed GPU UUID
and bytes, and always `inference_verified=false`. Any uncertainty after process
creation remains `unknown`; the controller must reconcile it before another start.
The first accepted queued task, not a hidden smoke generation, proves inference.

### Bounded public model transfer

After the locked environment and import probe pass, bootstrap invokes
`studio_platform.runtime_hosts.wangp_download` in one owned Linux child. It uses
the **existing locked** `huggingface_hub`/`hf_xet` packages; it does not install an
SDK or snapshot a repository. Each call names an exact manifest file and full
repository revision, with the official Hub endpoint and literal `token=False`.
Inherited Hub identity, endpoint and debug settings are removed for this child.

At most two files transfer concurrently, with at most two SDK invocations per
file. The SDK owns its partial files and transfer retries; this helper does not
implement HTTP Range or replay bootstrap. Existing SDK partial files are retained
within that preparation. HTTP fallback supports SDK resume; native Xet byte reuse
across interruption is **not qualified by the fake SDK tests**. New ephemeral
GPU instances do not gain a persistent model cache from this change.

The parent watches a two-hour model-transfer deadline, free disk headroom and the
isolated Hub/Xet cache (a watched 1 GiB threshold, not a filesystem quota, with
chunk/shard caches disabled). The child
also arms an independent Linux OS timer and parent-death termination before SDK
import. Failure stops and reaps that exact child; an unconfirmed stop remains an
obligation. Preparation-idle checks count the download child. SDK/native stdout,
stderr and Xet file logs are suppressed; protected receipts contain only static
error codes and completed-file/byte totals. Those totals are not network progress:
Xet may preallocate files. The initial disk check conservatively requires all
missing model sizes plus 10 GiB free, even if SDK partial files already exist.

`downloaded_unverified` is transfer completion only. The existing complete
size/hash checks still run before runtime launch and inside the owned launcher.
This source change neither modifies the model manifest nor enables a new runtime
configuration. Offline fake SDK and inert Linux process tests establish these
guards; actual download throughput, interruption reuse and cold-start duration
need a separately authorized future host measurement.

Environment attestation of an extracted package uses its hash-bound
`.sixnine-environment.json`; the original git-checkout path remains available for
the historical candidate. Both paths retain core-version and complete model-file
checks. A guest cannot prove its own OCI identity: the controller/provider must
verify that separately. Native libraries and model execution still need the
authorized GPU test and exact release evidence.

The launcher owns the listener, loopback authentication token, process lifetime,
journal, immutable input storage and Worker transport. These helpers do not
start anything merely by being imported:

1. `config_for_model_root(model_root)` produces a non-secret `wgp_config.json`.
   Write that exact filename in a protected configuration directory. Its single
   absolute `checkpoints_paths` entry is the same directory verified below.
   Do not add a `.` fallback, UI plugins, other accounts or saved GUI presets.
2. `verify_runtime(runtime_root, config_path, manifest_path, model_root)` checks
   source HEAD, tracked modifications, untracked executable source, core package
   versions and every model file's size/hash. It returns dated-run evidence for
   the caller to save and explicitly reports `inference_verified=False`.
   The source/config/weight tree must remain private and immutable after this
   check. A full dependency lock and container attestation remain separate gates.
3. `create_session(runtime_root, config_path, output_dir)` explicitly imports
   `shared.api.init(root=..., config_path=..., output_dir=..., cli_args=["--attention",
   "sdpa", "--profile", "4"], console_output=False, webui_state=None)`.
   This call initializes the runtime; it is not an offline test. The directory
   must already exist. Model loading/readiness does not qualify inference.
4. Wrap the facade in `WanGPHost` with durable receipts. Inputs are immutable
   `InputDescriptor` values. The host resolver replaces `image_start`/`image_end`
   opaque handles only with its own hash-verified private files. No client path,
   URL, arbitrary workflow or Python code is accepted.
5. Construct `H3FL2VACompiler(manifest, transport.stage_input)`. Its callback
   receives `(descriptor, source_stream, heartbeat=...)`, must verify both digest
   and size, and return the same descriptor. The worker retains the same job ID,
   request hash, attempt tag, manifest binding and source asset ownership.

Upstream `Session.close()` waits for its generation lock and unloads the model;
it is not a cancellation acknowledgement. Do not release host ownership while
a live GPU thread can still execute. Host/process replacement must preserve and
quarantine nonterminal receipts rather than infer the old attempt stopped.

## Controls and exact mapping

The public schema comes from `wangp_compiler.control_schema()`, and the machine
envelope is also recorded in `manifest.json`. New requests are normalized before
admission; old Comfy snapshots are never rewritten. A rejected control produces
a stable error before staging/submission.

| Platform intent | Upstream setting / behavior | First recipe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BF16 Base | `model_type=minimax_h3_fl2va`, config `bf16,bf16`, startup transformer/text quantization `bf16` | Fixed; no pruned, turbo, INT8, FP8, LoRA or VDN substitution |
| Steps | `num_inference_steps=50` | Fixed 50; handler's default 20 is explicitly overridden |
| Prompt | `prompt`, `multi_prompts_gen_type=FG`, enhancer disabled | One prompt including all lines; exactly one task/output |
| Seed | Decimal uint64 converted to Python integer | Exact value; public admission generates an omitted seed once |
| Resolution | Exact `WIDTHxHEIGHT` from the accepted native output spec | Existing 480P/576P/768P/custom area and aspect rules |
| Duration | Integer `video_length` on native `17*k+5` grid, `force_fps="24"` | 107–362 native frames; preserve both native and requested durations |
| First/last image | `image_start`, `image_end`; explicit `S`, `TE`, `SE` flags | Zero, one or two image assets; no references/video/audio inputs |
| Reference sizing | Startup `fit_canvas=2` | Explicit center crop to the requested canvas; source images cannot silently alter resolution |
| Sampling | `sample_solver=euler`, `flow_shift=12`, `guidance_phases=1` | Native scheduler only; audio sigma shift is fixed 3; guidance fixed 1 |
| Decode | Video tiled 256, overlap 64; native temporal clip length 17; audio normal | No normal video decode, adjustable temporal tiles or forced CPU encoder |
| Sound | Native joint generation; `_api.return_audio=True` | `generate_audio=True` only for this recipe; false is rejected, not ignored |
| Export | Native MP4 + exact generated audio tensor, then existing platform export | Raw H.264 CRF10/AAC; delivered H.264 CRF18 + separate FLAC |

### Why some familiar options are rejected

- Default quantization is INT8 in [wgp.py lines 2647–2675](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/wgp.py#L2647-L2675).
  The BF16 transformer choice is explicit in [model selection lines 3009–3071](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/wgp.py#L3009-L3071).
  The Qwen and video VAE configuration groups are [handler lines 669–689](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/models/minimax_h3/minimax_h3_handler.py#L669-L689).
  The video VAE menu calls its option BF16, but the actual selected file is FP16;
  this manifest records its real precision.
- [Handler lines 1204–1220](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/models/minimax_h3/minimax_h3_handler.py#L1204-L1220)
  defaults to 20 steps. The recipe overrides it. [Pipeline lines 743–775](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/models/minimax_h3/pipeline.py#L743-L775)
  consumes solver, steps, shift and frames, but does not consume the generic
  `guide_scale` keyword forwarded by the outer UI. Guidance is not advertised as
  an adjustable control. [Lines 1148–1151](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/models/minimax_h3/pipeline.py#L1148-L1151)
  show the independent fixed audio shift of 3.
- [Pipeline lines 499–500](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/models/minimax_h3/pipeline.py#L499-L500)
  ignores the requested VAE tile size and always enables 256-pixel tiles.
  [Video autoencoder lines 691, 748–779](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/models/minimax_h3/components/video_autoencoder.py#L691-L779)
  sets clip length 17 and overlap 64. Passing Comfy's temporal tile controls would
  therefore be misleading; they are rejected rather than discarded.
- Resolution follows input images by default in [wgp.py lines 7380–7390 and
  7739–7767](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/wgp.py#L7739-L7767).
  Explicit crop-to-canvas configuration preserves the accepted resolution.
- The pinned [video codec table](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/shared/utils/video_codecs.py#L46-L77)
  maps `libx264_8` to CRF10; `libx264_18` is not an actual selectable CRF18 codec.
  The existing platform worker, not a guessed upstream option, applies the
  requested final export CRF. Native frames are retained in the raw receipt;
  the platform's existing explicit requested-duration export can shorten delivery.

## Result and cancellation semantics

`SessionJob.cancel()` only sets cancellation intent. `done`/`result()` are the
completion evidence ([shared/api.py lines 511–544](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/shared/api.py#L511-L544)).
The headless runner normally completes its generation worker, clears `active_job`,
then sets the result in [shared/api_cli.py](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/shared/api_cli.py).
Its outer exception path can publish a result before that daemon worker stops.
The facade therefore also checks the pinned `wangp-session-worker` thread and
requires successful CUDA synchronization before reporting terminal stop proof.
Acknowledgement, timeout and an empty queue are insufficient. A runtime exception
is sanitized; partial files are not success.

Success requires one successful task, no error, exactly one MP4, and the matching
audio artifact. H3 returns sample-major stereo float32 NumPy samples at 32kHz
([pipeline lines 1695–1721](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/models/minimax_h3/pipeline.py#L1695-L1721)).
`_api.return_audio=True` retains those samples in `GeneratedArtifact`
([shared/api.py lines 319–339](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/shared/api.py#L319-L339);
[wgp.py lines 8671–8678](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/blob/0e58385fbde7ff102d276e4a9e490845de76b4ea/wgp.py#L8671-L8678)).
The facade writes IEEE float32 WAV without reconstructing it from the lossy AAC
track, preserves the native MP4, and hands both to the host for checksum sealing.
Failure during packaging retries the same completed result; it never regenerates.
A crash before durable sealing remains unknown for reconciliation, not safe retry.

Legacy/default worker export uses the requested integer duration (for example
120 frames for 5 seconds), while the native H3 sample can have 124 frames. D3 adds
the opt-in `native-frames-v1` delivery contract to preserve all native frames and
the complete generated waveform for new separately qualified WanGP plans.
It requires matching operator-policy, cold-approval, boot and worker capability
identities; an existing configuration or accepted task is not silently upgraded.
See [the output contract](../../GENERATION-CONTRACT.md#6-output-contract) for
duration/audio validation and compatibility. Current first-proof configuration
remains on its original export behavior. CPU numbered-frame evidence establishes
export behavior only: B3 should first prove text-to-video, and a real first/last
example is still needed before claiming qualified last-frame fidelity.

## Checks and remaining gates

### Repair preparation while preserving the accepted job

The protected host entry `deploy/platform/preparation_hold_recovery.py` supports
an explicit source-only repair of a retained `bootstrap_failed` hold. All pool
rentals must be destroyed with settled billing, with no inference attempt or
fleet start. Engine, model, dependency archive, policy, budget and original
waiting deadline remain unchanged. Expired/cancelled jobs cannot be restored.

After independent source/image review and exact-version host approval, stage
the target configuration and only the changed public source files under
`gpu-scaler/operator/preparation-repairs/<operation-uuid>`. Ordered actions are
`freeze`, `prepare --job-id <original-id>`, `retire`, `stage`, then an explicit
root-supervised `resume`. Each action holds the host release lock. Resume
activates the existing provider-enabled controller; staging does not. The
existing next-cycle transfer keeps the original request, reservation and deadline.

An uncertain response or durable `*_started` phase requires reconciliation;
never repeat it automatically. Exact controller ownership, the database fence
and retirement evidence must agree. This helper cannot replace the accepted
runtime or clear unknown execution. Its docstring/tests specify file modes and
supported boundaries. Staging failures and attempted inference use separate
recovery paths.

### Optional repair for measured provider SSH package drift

The provider's [pinned SSH bootstrap](https://github.com/Datura-ai/lium-io/blob/ec31b1ecd9b5f4d594d88d7c1c8ecbfa7cdd7228/neurons/validators/src/services/assets/sshd_bootstrap.sh#L140-L175)
can install `openssh-server` after the base image starts. A disposable CPU replay
of that operation on the pinned PyTorch base upgraded `libsystemd0` from
`249.11-0ubuntu3.12` to `249.11-0ubuntu3.22`; replaying the original 199 dependency
archives left this one mismatch against the unchanged 425-package environment.
This reproduction does not establish the contents of an already deleted host.

For this exact side effect, an operator can include a finite local repair kit:

```sh
python deploy/wangp/package_tool.py source-bundle --output wangp-package.tar.gz \
  --os-restore-kit /path/to/verified-kit --environment-lock /path/to/original-environment-lock.json
```

The kit contains `manifest.json` and six official amd64 archives from the signed
[Ubuntu snapshot](https://snapshot.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/20250101T000000Z/):
`libsystemd0`, `systemd`, `libnss-systemd`, `libpam-systemd`, `systemd-sysv`, and
`systemd-timesyncd`, all at `249.11-0ubuntu3.12`. Their exact names, sizes and SHA256
values are pinned in `wangp_system_restore.py`. The kit is private deployment
material; do not commit binaries. Its manifest binds the original environment
digest and base image, and the approved source-bundle SHA binds the complete kit.

Bootstrap accepts only the measured `.22` family or a partially restored `.12`
family, rejects unrelated environment differences, and validates every archive
before installing the complete dependency closure. It does not fetch packages
or run `apt install` on the GPU. It then requires the original environment pins,
`dpkg --audit`, dependency consistency, and `sshd -t`. A matching original
environment is unchanged. This is an exact repair, not a weaker lock, new model,
new environment identity, or proof of GPU inference. A different drift requires
diagnosis and a separately reviewed repair or a new qualified runtime identity.

`test_platform_wangp_compiler.py` and `test_platform_wangp_session.py` use isolated
fake Session objects/files only. They cover control rejection, immutable identities,
role mapping, uint64 seeds, cancellation intent, both outputs, collection retry,
lookup-root binding and escaped output rejection. They do not import WanGP/torch,
download weights or assert real video/audio quality. Real media validation is the
Worker's existing responsibility.

Before enabling this recipe publicly: verify the installed runtime and files,
qualify a real accepted job through the complete API-to-download path, record the
actual native/delivered media specs and audio stream, then reconcile cost/lease
evidence. Adding further controls or variants requires a distinct declared and
tested recipe; it must not weaken the immutable manifest binding of existing jobs.
